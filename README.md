# VSD_Internship_Project
## Vending_Machine_with_Change_System
My design is a **Vending Machine with Change System**. The project aims to match the functional simulation results obtained from the RTL block and Gate-Synthesized block as closely as possible.

>Through this Repo, I intend to document my weekly learnings & progress for this project.
